I divided the layout of the page into three parts: 1.navigation 2.main 3.footer.
The most difficult thing for me to do was the layout. It's too messy and hard to do it with float or inline stuff. 
So I learned a bit of FlexBox and used it. FlexBox is great but it is still not good enough for vertical layout. I guess because
it is one-dimensional. In later projects I will primarily use Grid and will probably combine the two.

I would also like to hear your invaluable feedback to improve my coding skills. Good luck.
